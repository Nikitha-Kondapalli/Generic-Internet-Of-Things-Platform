Project involves creation of platform between sensors and the end application. 
The data from the sensors is collected by gateway (raspberry pi) and stored. The server pulls this data from registered gateway and stores in in database. 
Based on the requirement the server sends sensor data to the end user application.
To test the platform A/C controller simulator will be built on top of this platform which receives the data and act accordingly.
